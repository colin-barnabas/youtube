# youtube
Play songs from youtube given a youtube url or a search string. Uses youtube-dl and the mpv player.

# Install

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload :youtube)
```

Install the [mpv](https://mpv.io/) player and
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

# Usage

Play a known url
```common-lisp
(play "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skpQ-joyuLw")
```

Or let youtube-dl search for a youtube url given an artist name and a song name and play that
```common-lisp
(play "anathema one last goodbye")
```

This will start an mpv player instance listening on the */tmp/mpv-cl-socket*
socket. By default, mpv runs with no video support, in the background.

Following this, you can control the playback by pausing the player, rewinding,
opening a youtube page or querying the playback position. See the API for
details.

# API

**play** _url-or-song &key (video nil) (pos "0")_
   
    Play the youtube url through mpv. If `video` is T, open the video with mpv
    player, if not, run mpv in the background. If position is specified, in seconds,
    start playback from there. If the youtube link is valid but the video is
    unavailable for some reason, return nil and don't play anything.

    Toggle playing status.

**replay**
  
    Rewind the song at the beginning, effectively replaying it.
